# WP User Frontend — CLAUDE.md

## What This Is

WP User Frontend (WPUF) is a WordPress plugin that enables frontend content management — post submission, user registration/login, dashboards, subscriptions, guest posting, content restriction, and AI form building. Requires PHP 5.6+.

Per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files auto-load when Claude works in that path:
- [`includes/Fields/CLAUDE.md`](includes/Fields/CLAUDE.md) — form field contract & conventions
- [`tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md`](tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md) — Playwright patterns

## Non-Negotiables

- **Preserve existing behavior.** Hooks, filters, public methods, REST routes, template paths, and shortcodes are contracts — don't change signatures or drop parameters silently.
- **Legacy code stays.** The site frontend, field types, payments, LESS and Grunt coexist with the React admin platform intentionally. Don't rewrite legacy code without explicit permission; renamed classes keep a `class_alias` stub at the old name.
- **Free/Pro split matters.** Never assume Pro features exist. Detect with `class_exists('WP_User_Frontend_Pro')`.
- **Scope discipline.** No drive-by refactors. Note unrelated issues separately instead of fixing them inline.

## Admin platform revamp (branch `feature/react-admin-revamp`)

Every admin screen runs on a FlyHR-style platform (`includes/Platform/`, `includes/Admin/Screens/`, `src/admin/`, `@wedevs/plugin-ui` with the old Vue look, Dokan-style hooks) as one React app on `admin.php?page=wp-user-frontend`; old admin URLs redirect to their route. Read [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) first (boot flow and the "where is X" map). Rules: stored data frozen (untouched save changes nothing), WPUF keeps firing every hook it owns, Pro modules and User Directory are not edited, every in-scope button is the shared `Button` wrapper, pnpm on that branch, tracked docs are committed with the work. Plan and evidence: `openspec/changes/revamp-admin-react-flyhr/` in the dev site.

## Quick Reference

### Entry Point
- `wpuf.php` — Main plugin file, defines constants, loads autoloader, bootstraps `WP_User_Frontend` singleton

### Initialization Flow
1. `wpuf.php` loads Composer autoloader (`vendor/autoload.php`)
2. Defines constants (`WPUF_VERSION`, `WPUF_FILE`, `WPUF_ROOT`, etc.)
3. Creates `WP_User_Frontend` singleton via `wpuf()` helper
4. Manually includes `wpuf-functions.php`, `Frontend_Render_Form`, reCaptcha libs, AI manager, and gateway helpers
5. On `plugins_loaded`: loads insights tracker, free/pro loader, upgrades, and instantiates all services into `$this->container[]`
6. Services available via magic getter: `wpuf()->service_name`

### Key PHP Files
- `wpuf-functions.php` — Global utility functions (6,782 lines, the largest file)
- `includes/Assets.php` — Script/style registration and enqueuing
- `includes/Frontend_Render_Form.php` / `includes/Render_Form.php` — Core form rendering engine
- `includes/User_Subscription.php` — Subscription plan management
- `includes/Installer.php` — Plugin activation, DB table creation
- `includes/API.php` — builds the three frozen REST controllers (`wpuf()->api`); routes are registered by `Platform\REST\Manager`
- `includes/AI_Manager.php` — AI form builder orchestration

### Service Container
Simple array-based container with magic `__get()`. Services accessed via `wpuf()->service_name`. Major services:
`assets`, `subscription`, `fields`, `customize`, `bank`, `paypal`, `gateway_manager`, `api`, `integrations`, `ai_manager`, `admin`, `frontend`, `ajax`, `setup_wizard`, `pro_upgrades`, `privacy`, `widgets`, `tracker`, `free_loader`, `upgrades`

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vue 3** (primary) for modern admin and frontend components, with Pinia state management and Vue Router
- **jQuery** (legacy) for form builder and older frontend interactions
- **Vite** builds the two Vue apps that remain (frontend-subscriptions, account); the admin lists, builders, subscriptions, settings and the AI form builder are React apps built with wp-scripts (`webpack.admin.config.js`)
- **Grunt** for legacy build tasks (LESS compilation, Tailwind CSS, release packaging)
- **Tailwind CSS 3** with DaisyUI component library and scoped preflight
- **LESS** (legacy) for older stylesheets

### REST API
Namespace `wpuf/v1`. Controllers live in `includes/Platform/REST/Controllers/` on the `Platform\REST\RestController` base: the admin routes (`FormsController`, `ToolsController`, `TransactionsController`, `OnboardingController`) and the frozen routes (`FormListController`, `SubscriptionController`, `SettingsController`). The AI form builder keeps its controller with its feature (`includes/AI/RestController.php`); Pro adds its own under `wpuf-pro/includes/Platform/<Feature>/`. `Platform\REST\Manager` registers all of them once on `rest_api_init`; permissions come from `Platform\Caps`.

### Payment System
Payment gateways managed through `Lib/Gateway/`:
- `Gateway_Manager.php` — Gateway registration and orchestration
- `Paypal_Gateway.php` / `Paypal.php` — PayPal integration
- `Bank_Gateway.php` / `Bank.php` — Bank transfer support
- Frontend payment handling via `includes/Frontend/Payment.php`

### Form Fields System
20+ form field types under `includes/Fields/`, each extending `Field_Contract.php`:
Text, Textarea, Email, URL, Dropdown, MultiDropdown, Checkbox, Radio, Image, Featured Image, Post Title, Post Content, Post Excerpt, Post Tags, Post Taxonomy, Hidden, HTML, Section Break, Column, reCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile

## Coding Standards

- **PHP**: WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS) via PHPCS
- **JS**: JSHint (legacy), Prettier for formatting
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS 3 with DaisyUI
- **PHP Namespace**: `WeDevs\Wpuf\` for `includes/`, `WeDevs\Wpuf\Lib\` for `Lib/`

## Key Patterns

- **Singleton pattern** via `WeDevs\WpUtils\SingletonTrait` for main plugin class
- **Simple container** — array-based `$container[]` with magic `__get()` (not a formal DI container)
- **WordPress hooks** extensively used for extensibility (actions & filters)
- **Overridable templates** — themes can override templates from `templates/` directory
- **Free/Pro split** — `includes/Free/Free_Loader.php` loads free-only features; Pro version detected via `WP_User_Frontend_Pro` class
- **Form field contract** — all form fields implement `Field_Contract` for consistent rendering
- **Legacy + modern coexistence** — jQuery form builder alongside Vue 3 components, LESS alongside Tailwind, Grunt alongside Vite
- **Third-party integrations** — Dokan, WC Vendors, WC Marketplace, ACF, n8n, Events Calendar

## Testing

- **Playwright** for E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`
  - A single `playwright.config.ts` with `setup` / `e2e` / `api` projects (select via `--project`)
  - The `e2e` project is sharded via Playwright's native `--shard=i/n`
- **PHPUnit 7.5.9** listed as dev dependency (test infrastructure in development)

## Integrations

WPUF integrates with several marketplace and third-party plugins:
- **Dokan** — Vendor registration forms and dashboard integration
- **WC Vendors** — Vendor frontend forms
- **WC Marketplace** — Marketplace compatibility
- **ACF** — Advanced Custom Fields compatibility
- **n8n** — Workflow automation integration
- **Events Calendar** — Event post type support

## Code Review Prevention (MANDATORY)

**Apply these rules to ALL new/modified code. Top causes of review rejection.**

### Zero-Tolerance Rules

1. **Strict comparisons only** — `===`/`!==` always, never `==`/`!=`
2. **`in_array()`/`array_search()` strict** — always pass `true` as 3rd arg
3. **Superglobals** — `wp_unslash()` + sanitize every `$_POST/$_GET/$_REQUEST/$_SERVER` access. Use `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash(...))`, `absint()`, `sanitize_email(wp_unslash(...))`, `esc_url_raw(wp_unslash(...))`, `sanitize_key(wp_unslash(...))`
4. **Escape all output** — `esc_html()` for text, `esc_attr()` for attributes, `esc_url()` for URLs, `wp_kses_post()` for HTML
5. **SQL safety** — `$wpdb->prepare()` for ALL dynamic values. Allowlist column names for ORDER BY
6. **Nonce + permission** — every form/AJAX: `check_ajax_referer()` + `current_user_can(wpuf_admin_role())`

### Required Standards

7. **snake_case methods** — never camelCase in PHP
8. **DocBlocks** — `@since WPUF_SINCE` on every new public/protected method
9. **Translator comments** — `/* translators: */` before every `sprintf()` with `__()`
10. **Text domain** — `'wp-user-frontend'` (free), `'wpuf-pro'` (pro), never `'wpuf'`
11. **Hook prefix** — all `do_action()`/`apply_filters()` names start with `wpuf_`
12. **WP spacing** — `if ( $x )` not `if($x)`, `! $x` not `!$x`

### Pre-PR Checklist

Run `composer phpcs` — zero violations before submitting. See `wpuf-backend-dev` skill for full examples.
